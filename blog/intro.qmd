description: Introduction and tangent vector to my blogosphere
---

Hello friend! This is the first post in my new personal blog. I'm so happy you're here
and interested in reading my story! It's going to be a fun ride. 
Here's a little more about me besides what you see on the front page.

# Mathematics, Physics, and Science

I love understanding the world around me. When I was in high school calculus
I became fascinated by Euler's formula, and I was captivated with how everything
seemed to so neatly fall into place to prove it with Taylor expansions.
My love for math and physics also began at an early age with the Disney movie Flubber.
(Robin Williams was my inspiration for wanting to be a math professor!)
I could say so much more on these points, but remember this is only an introduction! ðŸ˜‰

# Music and Dance 

These have been there throughout my life in many different facets. At heart I
am a drummer, though I love playing many instruments, guitar and bass being next in line.
Besides being a music "producer" of sorts, I consume music through dance and movement
as well. I taught swing dancing for a few years in Eugene, Oregon (shoutout to Track Town Swing).
There is a lot more to say about this topic, so stay tuned.

# Mental Health and Wellness

I have had a very, very long and intense struggle with my mental health. I believe my
true diagnosis to be complex PTSD, and I have much more to say on that at a later date.
For now it's just a fact of my existence that my upbringing was difficult, and that it left
a lasting imprint on me. The upside is I am making huge strides in reigning it in, and
I feel so much more grounded now than at any point I can remember. I have a lot
to say about my mental health journey, though now is not the time.

# Storytelling 

After uncovering my inner self through my mental health journey has shown me that I have
a deep appreciation for stories and however they are told. Poetry, visual art, music, _books_,
doesn't matter. As long as it can be used to tell a story or a lesson, I am fascinated by it.
There are several books that have been hugely influential to me, and they're all science fiction 
for a reason. They all deserve their own series of blog posts from me, and they will come in time.

* _Dune_, by Frank Herbert
* _The Caves of Steel_, by Isaac Asimov
* _Foundation_, by Isaac Asimov

For now, suffice it to say that *everyone* ought to read _The Caves of Steel_. It's a story
about a human detective partnering with a robot to solve a crime. The only twist is, _nobody_ save
experts in robotics can tell this robot is _not_ a robot. The robot, named R. Daneel Olivaw, fools
most people into having them think he's a human.

While the story itself is entertaining, the reason I say everyone should read it is because it 
can teach us a valuable lesson about how our world is going to start changing due to artificial 
intelligence (AI). We are seeing ChatGPT revolutionize the way people do work, and it's going
to keep escelating with the large tech giants competing to make a better AI assistant, similar to
an R. Daneel Olivaw. More to come on this topic, but suffice it to say there are lessons we can
all learn from this science fiction in this time of large language models (LLMs) like chatGPT et.al.

# Intersections

I'm also interested in how all of these topics intersect! Who knows what's hidden there? Maybe nothing.
Maybe something? You decide! I will explore, and you're welcome to follow.
