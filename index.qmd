I'm Andrew Wray, and I am a data scientist and mathematician based in Seattle, WA. I completed my PhD
in Algebraic Geometry at the University of Oregon in June 2020 under the guidance of [Nick Addington](nick_webpage), and now I work
as a data scientist for [Fullpower Technologies]
developing and enhancing AI-based algorithms for
[Sleeptracker][sleeptracker]
In my spare time I enjoy reading science fiction, playing the drums and guitar,
and hanging out with my [cat][cat].

If you wish to get in contact with me, feel free to send me an [email][contact] or reach out on LinkedIn.
