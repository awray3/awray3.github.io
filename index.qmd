I'm Andrew Wray, and I am a data scientist and mathematician based in Seattle, WA.

I received my Bachelor's of Science in Math and Physics at Western Washington University in 2014,
where I was recognized as WWU Math Department's Outstanding Graduate.
I completed my PhD in Algebraic Geometry at the University of Oregon in June 2020
under the guidance of [Nick Addington](nick_webpage).
These days I work as a data scientist for [Fullpower Technologies][fullpower]
developing and enhancing AI-based algorithms for [Sleeptracker][sleeptracker].

If you wish to get in contact with me, feel free to send me an [email][contact]
