I'm Andrew Wray, and I am a data scientist and mathematician based in Seattle, WA. 

I received my Bachelor's of Science in Math and Physics at Western Washington University in 2014, where I was recognized as WWU Math Department's Outstanding Graduate. I completed my PhD in Algebraic Geometry at the University of Oregon in June 2020 under the guidance of [Nick Addington](nick_webpage). These days I work as a data scientist for [Fullpower Technologies][fullpower]
developing and enhancing AI-based algorithms for [Sleeptracker][sleeptracker].
In my spare time I enjoy reading science fiction, playing the drums and guitar,
and hanging out with my [cat][cat].

If you wish to get in contact with me, feel free to send me an [email][contact] 
or reach out on <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@awray">Mastodon</a>!
